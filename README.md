# TicTacToe
A Tic-Tac-Toe framework made using the pygame library for Python.

Four levels of difficulty have been implemented in the opponent AI, with the last one being unbeatable.

To download the pygame library, go to http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml. It is probable that the game will not work on a 64-bit version of Python, which is due to the lack of support by the pygame library.
